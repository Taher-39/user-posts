1. Create a ReactJS application with Tailwind CSS
2. Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to display the list of post on the page
3. Clicking on the post will redirect to another page, where you will be showing post details 
   with respective comments.
4. To display the post detail use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/<post id> and for 
   comments use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments api and filter the comments by
   post id and then display it.
